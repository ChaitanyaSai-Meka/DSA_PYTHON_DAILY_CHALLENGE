# 1432. Max Difference You Can Get From Changing an Integer

'''QUESTION'''
# You are given an integer num. You will apply the following steps to num two separate times:
# Pick a digit x (0 <= x <= 9).
# Pick another digit y (0 <= y <= 9). Note y can be equal to x.
# Replace all the occurrences of x in the decimal representation of num by y.
# Let a and b be the two results from applying the operation to num independently.
# Return the max difference between a and b.
# Note that neither a nor b may have any leading zeros, and must not be 0.

'''Example-1'''
# Input: num = 555
# Output: 888
# Explanation: The first time pick x = 5 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
# The second time pick x = 5 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
# We have now a = 999 and b = 111 and max difference = 888

'''Example-2'''
# Input: num = 9
# Output: 8
# Explanation: The first time pick x = 9 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
# The second time pick x = 9 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
# We have now a = 9 and b = 1 and max difference = 8

'''Constraints:'''
# 1 <= num <= 108

'''SOLUTION'''
class Solution:
    def maxDiff(self, num: int) -> int:
        s = str(num)

        for i in s:
            if i != '9':
                max_num = int(s.replace(i, '9'))
                break
        else:
            max_num = num
        if s[0] != '1':
            min_num = int(s.replace(s[0], '1'))
        else:
            for j in s[1:]:
                if j not in {'0', '1'}:
                    min_num = int(s.replace(j, '0'))
                    break
            else:
                min_num = num 

        return max_num - min_num
