# 2014. Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times

'''QUESTION'''
# You are given a string s of length n, and an integer k. You are tasked to find the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s.
# A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
# A subsequence seq is repeated k times in the string s if seq * k is a subsequence of s, where seq * k represents a string constructed by concatenating seq k times.
# For example, "bba" is repeated 2 times in the string "bababcba", because the string "bbabba", constructed by concatenating "bba" 2 times, is a subsequence of the string "bababcba".
# Return the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the lexicographically largest one. If there is no such subsequence, return an empty string.

'''Example-1'''
# Input: s = "letsleetcode", k = 2
# Output: "let"
# Explanation: There are two longest subsequences repeated 2 times: "let" and "ete".
# "let" is the lexicographically largest one.

'''Example-2'''
# Input: s = "bb", k = 2
# Output: "b"
# Explanation: The longest subsequence repeated 2 times is "b".

'''Example-3'''
# Input: s = "ab", k = 2
# Output: ""
# Explanation: There is no subsequence repeated 2 times. Empty string is returned.

'''Constraints:'''
# n == s.length
# 2 <= n, k <= 2000
# 2 <= n < k * 8
# s consists of lowercase English letters.

                    continue
                if is_val(candi):
                    queue.append(candi)
                    if len(candi) > len(res) or (len(candi) == len(res) and candi > res):
