# 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence

'''QUESTION'''
# We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.
# Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

'''Example-1'''
# Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
# The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].

'''Example-2'''
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# The longest harmonious subsequences are [1,2], [2,3], and [3,4], all of which have a length of 2.

'''Example-3'''
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# No harmonic subsequence exists.

'''Constraints:'''
# 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
# -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

'''SOLUTION'''
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def findLHS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        c = Counter(nums)
        ans = 0
        for i in c:
            if i + 1 in c:
                ans = max(ans, c[i] + c[i + 1])
        return ans
