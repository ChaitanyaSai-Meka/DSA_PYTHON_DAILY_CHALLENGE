# 135. Candy

'''QUESTION'''
#There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.
# You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
# Each child must have at least one candy.
# Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
# Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

'''Example-1'''
# Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

'''Example-2'''
# Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
# The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

'''Constraints:'''
# n == ratings.length
# 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
# 0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104

'''SOLUTION'''
class Solution:
    def candy(self, r: List[int]) -> int:
        n=len(r)
        pre=[1]*(n)
        for i in range(1,n):
            if r[i]>r[i-1]:
                pre[i]=pre[i-1]+1
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if r[i]>r[i+1]:
                pre[i]=max(pre[i], pre[i+1] + 1)
        return (sum(pre))
