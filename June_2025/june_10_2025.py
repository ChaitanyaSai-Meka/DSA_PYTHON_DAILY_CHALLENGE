# 3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I

'''QUESTION'''
# You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.
# Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = a1 - a2 between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:
# a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
# a2 has an even frequency in the string.
# Return this maximum difference.

'''Example-1'''
# Input: s = "aaaaabbc"
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
# The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.

'''Example-2'''
# Input: s = "abcabcab"
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
# The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.

'''Constraints:'''
# 3 <= s.length <= 100
# s consists only of lowercase English letters.
# s contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.

'''SOLUTION'''
class Solution:
    def maxDifference(self, s: str) -> int:
        freq = {}
        for i in s:
            if i not in freq:
                freq[i] = 0
            freq[i] += 1
        max_ = 0
        min_ = len(s)
        for i in freq.values():
            if i%2==1 and i>max_:
                max_ = i
            elif i%2==0 and i<min_:
                min_ = i
        return max_ - min_
