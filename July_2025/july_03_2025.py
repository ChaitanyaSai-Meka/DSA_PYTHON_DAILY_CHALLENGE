# 3304. Find the K-th Character in String Game I

'''QUESTION'''
# Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = "a".
# You are given a positive integer k.
# Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation forever:
# Generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word.
# For example, performing the operation on "c" generates "cd" and performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".
# Return the value of the kth character in word, after enough operations have been done for word to have at least k characters.
# Note that the character 'z' can be changed to 'a' in the operation.

'''Example-1'''
# Input: k = 5
# Output: "b"
# Explanation:
# Initially, word = "a". We need to do the operation three times:
# Generated string is "b", word becomes "ab".
# Generated string is "bc", word becomes "abbc".
# Generated string is "bccd", word becomes "abbcbccd".

'''Example-2'''
# Input: k = 10
# Output: "c"

'''Constraints:'''
# 1 <= k <= 500

'''SOLUTION'''
class Solution:
    def kthCharacter(self, k: int) -> str:
        s="a"
        while(k>len(s)):
            n=len(s)
            for i in range(n): 
                s+=chr(ord(s[i])+1)
        return s[k-1]
